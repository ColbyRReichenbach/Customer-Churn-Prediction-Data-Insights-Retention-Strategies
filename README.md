# Customer Churn Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes **customer churn behavior** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning**.  
By identifying **key drivers of churn**, we can develop **data-driven retention strategies** and deploy a **predictive model**
to flag at-risk customers.  

**Objective:** Understand why customers churn and how to reduce it.  
**Approach:** Use **data analysis & machine learning models** to predict churn.  
**Outcome:** Develop **actionable insights & an AI-based flagging system** for at-risk customers.

## Dataset Information
This project uses the Telco Customer Churn Dataset, which contains customer data from a telecommunications company.

Source: [IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
Features: Customer demographics, contract details, payment methods, tenure, and churn status.
License: Publicly available for educational and research purposes.

The dataset was used to analyze customer churn patterns and train machine learning models for churn prediction.
